# Partially Ordered Sets

## The "Divides" Relation

Let $m$ and $n$ be integers. Recall that we say $m$ *divides* $n$, and we write $m \mid n$ if there exists an integer $q$ such that $mq = n$. For example, $3$ divides $6$ since $3 \cdot 2 = 6$, and $-5$ divides $10$ since $-5 \cdot 2 = 10$.

::: {#exr-2.1}
Show that if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers, and $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$, then $a \mid c$.

## Defining Posets
Let $\preccurlyeq$ denote a partial order relation.
